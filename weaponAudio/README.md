The example provided here is the x16 pistol for which I used [this post](https://www.gta5-mods.com) on https://www.gta5-mods.com. Since this is a pistol, I used the sns pistol as base template. Therefore the other sounds like reloading and such will be based on that. I have only replaced the `PlayerFire` entry which is the main firing sound.

If you just want to test this out. Run this resource (everything withing `weaponAudio`) and edit your weapon.meta of choice where you want to apply the sound. Find the `<Audio>` entry and replace it with `audio_item_x16pistol`.
